  abstract = {A large body of experimental evidence shows that animals as diverse as mammals, birds, and fish are capable of processing numerical information. Considerable differences have been reported in some cases among species and a wide debate currently surrounds the issue of whether all vertebrates share the same numerical systems or not. Part of the problem is due to the fact that these studies often use different methods, a circumstance that potentially introduces confounding factors in a comparative analysis. In most studies, two main methodological approaches have been used: spontaneous choice tests and training procedures. The former approach consists of presenting to the subjects two groups of biologically-relevant stimuli (e.g., food items or social companions) differing in numerosity with the assumption that if they are able to discriminate between the two quantities, they are expected to spontaneously select the larger/smaller quantity. In the latter approach, subjects undergo extensive training in which some neutral stimuli (e.g., a quantity of dots) are associated with a reward and the capacity to learn a numerical rule is taken as evidence of numerical abilities. We review the literature on this topic, highlighting the relevance, and potential weaknesses in controlling confounding factors obtained with either approach.},

In particular, the ability to select the larger of two quantities (known as the ability to go for “more”) has been found in apes, dolphins, birds and amphibians. This primary quantity discrimination has not been investigated in fish in a systematic way although several studies suggest that fish have the ability to distinguish among different-sized groups of conspecifics. We investigated the spontaneous choice for the larger of two shoals in female goldbelly topminnows (Girardinus falcatus) and compared two different methods to determine an efficient procedure for studying the numerical competence of fish. Female topminnows that were placed in a novel and potentially dangerous environment were found to choose the larger shoal suggesting that the capacity to go for “more” was similar to that observed in other non-verbal animals. The two methods proved not to be sensitive in revealing differences between the numerical contrasts, however, combining the results of the two experiments, we found that when groups differed in size by one individual, choice of the larger shoal was significantly above that predicted by chance up to a maximum of three fish in the larger shoal (i.e. 2 vs 1 and 3 vs 2 but not 4 vs 3 or larger). When presented with two shoals with a 1:2 numerical ratio, choice was significantly above chance in 4 vs 2 but not in 8 vs 4 comparisons.},

Experiments to control for non-numerical variables evidenced the role played by the total area of stimuli with both large and small numerosities; the total quantity of movement of the fish within a shoal appeared also important but only when large numerosities were involved. Even though the pattern of discrimination exhibited by female mosquitofish is not fully consistent with any of the existing models of quantity representation, our results seem to suggest two distinct mechanisms in fish, one used to compare small numbers of objects and one used when larger numerosities are involved.},

In one condition, continuous variables were controlled while numerical information was available; in another, the number was kept constant and information relating to continuous variables was available; in the third condition, stimuli differed for both number and continuous quantities. Fish learned to discriminate more quickly when both number and continuous information were available compared to when they could use continuous information only or number only; there was no difference in the learning rate between the two latter conditions. Our results do not support the hypothesis that processing numbers imposes a higher cognitive load than processing continuous variables. Rather, they suggest that availability of multiple information sources may facilitate discrimination learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Numerical abilities of mammals and birds have been studied both in natural conditions and in controlled laboratory conditions using a variety of approaches.

Here we reviewed the main methods used to study this group, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each of the methods used. Fish have only been studied under laboratory conditions and among the methods used with other species, only two have been systematically used in fish-spontaneous choice tests and discrimination learning procedures. In the former case, the choice between two options is observed in a biologically relevant situation and the degree of preference for the larger/smaller group is taken as a measure of the capacity to discriminate the two quantities (e.g., two shoals differing in number). In discrimination learning tasks, fish are trained to select the larger or the smaller of two sets of abstract objects, typically two-dimensional geometric figures, using food or social companions as reward. Beyond methodological differences, what emerges from the literature is a substantial similarity of the numerical abilities of fish with those of other vertebrates studied.},

  abstract = {The vocal repertoire of Philautus leucorhinus, a Rhacophorid frog, consists of several distinct call-types, each used in a different social context. Males defend space in choruses by calling, and ultimately by fighting off rival males. Vocal interactions between males begin with exchanges of territorial calls followed by multi-note calls. Males frequently ‘match’ their rival's preceding call by responding with a multi-note call containing a similar number of notes. Vocal interactions become more escalated as the distance between males decreases but the accuracy of matching is apparently unaffected by distance. Males respond to playbacks of advertisement calls or territorial calls by increasing the frequency of territorial calls and the number of notes in their calls. It is suggested that the level of escalation in vocal interactions is a graded threat, signalling the probability of attack. Two explanations of vocal matching are offered: matching may be an effective means of directing threat signals at a particular rival and/or it may be a consequence of vocal competition for females.},

  abstract = {Animals can perceive the numerosity of sets of visual elements. Qualitative and quantitative similarities in different species suggest the existence of a shared system (approximate number system). Biases associated with sensory properties are informative about the underlying mechanisms. In humans, regular spacing increases perceived numerosity (regular-random numerosity illusion). This has led to a model that predicts numerosity based on occupancy (a measure that decreases when elements are close together). We used a procedure in which observers selected one of two stimuli and were given feedback with respect to whether the choice was correct. One configuration had 20 elements and the other 40, randomly placed inside a circular region. Participants had to discover the rule based on feedback. Because density and clustering covaried with numerosity, different dimensions could be used. After reaching a criterion, test trials presented two types of configurations with 30 elements. One type had a larger interelement distance than the other (high or low clustering). If observers had adopted a numerosity strategy, they would choose low clustering (if reinforced with 40) and high clustering (if reinforced with 20). A clustering or density strategy predicts the opposite. Human adults used a numerosity strategy. Chicks were tested using a similar procedure. There were two behavioral measures: first approach response and final circumnavigation (walking behind the screen). The prediction based on numerosity was confirmed by the first approach data. For chicks, one clear pattern from both responses was a preference for the configurations with higher clustering. (PsycINFO Database Record},

While experiments in mammals and birds have employed a variety of stimuli (visual, auditory and tactile), all fish studies involved visual stimuli and it is unknown whether fish can process numbers in other sensory modalities. To fill this gap, we studied numerical abilities in Phreatichthys andruzzii, a blind cave-dwelling species that evolved in the phreatic layer of the Somalia desert. Fish were trained to receive a food reward to discriminate between two groups of objects placed in opposite positions of their home tank. In Experiment 1, subjects learned to discriminate between two and six objects, with stimuli not controlled for non-numerical continuous variables that co-vary with numbers, such as total area occupied by stimuli or density. In Experiment 2, the discrimination was two versus four, with half of the stimuli controlled for continuous quantities and half not controlled for continuous quantities. The subjects discriminated only the latter condition, indicating that they spontaneously used non-numerical information, as other vertebrates tested in similar experiments. In Experiments 3 and 4, cavefish trained from the beginning only with stimuli controlled for continuous quantities proved able to learn the discrimination of quantities based on the sole numerical information. However, their numerical acuity was lower than that reported in other teleost fish tested with visual stimuli.},

The guppy (Poecilia reticulata), the only teleost examined following procedures that allow a comparison with the other vertebrates, outperforms amphibians, reptiles and many warm-blooded vertebrates, but it is unclear whether this is a feature shared with the other teleosts or represents a peculiarity of this species. We trained zebrafish (Danio rerio) to discriminate between numbers differing by one unit, varying task difficulty from 2 versus 3 to 5 versus 6 items. Non-numerical variables that covary with number, such as density or area, did not affect performance. Most fish reached learning criterion on all tasks up to 4 versus 5 discrimination with no sex difference in accuracy. Although no individual reached learning criterion in the 5 versus 6 task, performance was significant at the group level, suggesting that this may represent the discrimination threshold for zebrafish. Numerosity discrimination abilities of zebrafish compare to those of guppy, being higher than in some warm-blooded vertebrates, such as dogs, horses and domestic fowl, though lower than in parrots, corvids and primates. Learning rate was similar in a control group trained to discriminate between different-sized shapes, but zebrafish were slightly more accurate when discriminating areas than numbers and males were more accurate than females. At the end of the experiment, fish trained on numbers and controls trained on areas generalized to the reciprocal set of stimuli, indicating they had used a relational strategy to solve these tasks.},

One possibility is that animals use ratio to determine differences in group sizes. Weber's Law states that the ease of any numerical comparison is based on the ratio between the stimuli compared; as the ratio becomes smaller the comparison becomes more difficult. We set out to test this prediction by offering female green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, dichotomous choices between different shoal sizes, varying both in ratios and absolute numbers of fish. Swordtails attended to the ratio of group size between stimulus shoals, rather than the numerical difference between shoals, when making shoaling decisions. Where group size ratio was 2:1, subjects showed a significant preference for the larger shoal, independent of the numerical difference between the shoals. When the ratio was 1.5:1, subjects showed no preference. The ratio between group sizes may, thus, be an important factor in shoaling decisions. More broadly, ratio could prove to be a widespread mechanism for animals to make numerical comparisons in group assessments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {In this study, we used a biologically relevant experimental procedure to ask whether mealworm beetles (Tenebrio molitor) are spontaneously capable of assessing quantities based on numerical cues. Like other insect species, mealworm beetles adjust their reproductive behavior (i.e., investment in mate guarding) according to the perceived risk of sperm competition (i.e., probability that a female will mate with another male). To test whether males have the ability to estimate numerosity based on numerical cues, we staged matings between virgin females and virgin males in which we varied the number of rival males the experimental male had access to immediately preceding mating as a cue to sperm competition risk (from 1 to 4). Rival males were presented sequentially, and we controlled for continuous cues by ensuring that males in all treatments were exposed to the same amount of male–male contact. Males exhibited a marked increase in the time they devoted to mate guarding in response to an increase in the number of different rival males they were exposed to. Since males could not rely on continuous cues we conclude that they kept a running tally of the number of individuals they encountered serially, which meets the requirements of the basic ordinality and cardinality principles of proto-counting. Our results thus offer good evidence of “true” numerosity estimation or quantity estimation and, along with recent studies in honey-bees, suggest that vertebrates and invertebrates share similar core systems of non-verbal numerical representation.},

  abstract = {Here we investigate the counting ability in honeybees by training them to receive a food reward after they have passed a specific number of landmarks. The distance to the food reward is varied frequently and randomly, whilst keeping the number of intervening landmarks constant. Thus, the bees cannot identify the food reward in terms of its distance from the hive. We find that bees can count up to four objects, when they are encountered sequentially during flight. Furthermore, bees trained in this way are able count novel objects, which they have never previously encountered, thus demonstrating that they are capable of object-independent counting. A further experiment reveals that the counting ability that the bees display in our experiments is primarily sequential in nature. It appears that bees can navigate to food sources by maintaining a running count of prominent landmarks that are passed en route, provided this number does not exceed four.},

  abstract = {Animals can form groups for various reasons including safety from predators, access to potential mates and benefits of allo-parental care. However, there are costs associated with living in a group such as competition for food and/or mates with other members of the group, higher chances of disease transmission, etc. Group size dynamics can change with the biotic and abiotic environment around individuals. In the current study, we explored the links between group size dynamics and intestinal parasites of Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus) in the context of seasons and food provisioning. Data for group size was collected across three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon) at three field sites (Morachi Chincholi, Nashik and Rajasthan). Individual and group sightings of peafowl were noted down along with group size and composition (no. of males, females, adults, juveniles and sub-adults). Faecal samples were collected from food provision and non-provision areas across the same three seasons at same field sites. Parasite load in the samples was quantified using microscopic examination. Group size was significantly higher in pre-monsoon season as compared with monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Monsoon and post-monsoon seasons had higher intestinal parasite prevalence and load as compared with pre-monsoon season. Thus, group size and intestinal parasites of Indian peafowl have an inverse relationship across seasons. Parasite load was significantly greater at food provision sites as compared with non-provision sites while parasite prevalence was comparable. Aggregation of individuals at the food provision sites may influence the parasite transmission and group-size dynamics in Indian peafowl. In conclusion, Indian peafowl are behaviourally plastic and fission-fusion of social groups may allow them to tackle ecological pressures such as predation and parasite transmission in different seasons.},

Therefore, we recorded single-neuron activity from the endbrain of crows trained to judge the number of items in displays. Many neurons were tuned for numerosities irrespective of the physical appearance of the items, and their activity correlated with performance outcome. Comparison of both behavioral and neuronal representations of numerosity revealed that the data are best described by a logarithmically compressed scaling of numerical information, as postulated by the Weber–Fechner law. The behavioral and neuronal numerosity representations in the crow reflect surprisingly well those found in the primate association cortex. This finding suggests that distantly related vertebrates with independently developed endbrains adopted similar neuronal solutions to process quantity.},

Based on the relative close phylogenetic relationship (and thus equivalent brain structures), non-verbal numerical representations in human and non-human primates show almost identical behavioural signatures that obey the Weber–Fechner law. However, whether numerosity discriminations of vertebrates with a very different endbrain organization show the same behavioural signatures remains unknown. Therefore, we tested the numerical discrimination performance of two carrion crows (Corvus corone) to a broad range of numerosities from 1 to 30 in a delayed match-to-sample task similar to the one used previously with primates. The crows' discrimination was based on an analogue number system and showed the Weber-fraction signature (i.e. the ‘just noticeable difference’ between numerosity pairs increased in proportion to the numerical magnitudes). The detailed analysis of the performance indicates that numerosity representations in crows are scaled on a logarithmically compressed ‘number line’. Because the same psychophysical characteristics are found in primates, these findings suggest fundamentally similar number representations between primates and birds. This study helps to resolve a classical debate in psychophysics: the mental number line seems to be logarithmic rather than linear, and not just in primates, but across vertebrates.},

Transfer tests with novel stimuli confirmed that the birds’ choices were based on relative differences in numerosity. However, pigeons differed from other species in the non-numerical cues that affected their choices. In human and non-human primates, numerical discrimination is often influenced by continuous variables such as surface area or overall stimulus brightness. Pigeons showed little evidence of using those cues, even when summed area and brightness had been correlated with numerosity differences and reward outcome. But when array-element sizes were asymmetrically distributed across numerosities, the birds readily utilized information about item sizes as an additional discriminative cue. These novel results are discussed in relation to pigeons’ tendency to focus on local, rather than global dimensions when they process other non-numerical complex visual stimuli. The findings suggest there may be inter-specific differences in the type of perceptual information that provides the input stage for mechanisms underlying numerical processing.

In the present study, we examined capuchins’ performance in a more sophisticated quantity judgment task that required the ability to form representations of food quantities while viewing the quantities only one piece at a time. In three experiments, we presented monkeys with the choice between two sets of discrete homogeneous food items and allowed the monkeys to consume the set of their choice. In Experiments 1 and 2, monkeys compared an entirely visible food set to a second set, presented item-by-item into an opaque container. All monkeys exhibited high accuracy in choosing the larger set, even when the entirely visible set was presented last, preventing the use of one-to-one item correspondence to compare quantities. In Experiment 3, monkeys compared two sets that were each presented item-by-item into opaque containers, but at diVerent rates to control for temporal cues. Some monkeys performed well in this experiment, though others exhibited near-chance performance, suggesting that this species’ ability to form representations of food quantities may be limited compared to previously tested species such as chimpanzees. Overall, these Wndings support the analog magnitude model of quantity representation as an explanation for capuchin monkeys’ quantiWcation of sequentially presented food items.},

We tested if wild, free-living Northern Mockingbirds (Mimus polyglottos) could solve a novel foraging problem to attain food rewards with the least amount of effort. We introduced five subjects to experimental feeders in their winter territories in an urban habitat. Feeders contained different numbers of bamboo sticks at each of two ends. Birds could access a food reward (Tenebrio larvae) by removing all sticks from either end; therefore, the optimal choice was to remove sticks from the end with fewer sticks. Each subject was tested in repeated trials to determine if it preferentially chose the end with fewer sticks. All five birds successfully discriminated between one stick and six sticks as well as between two sticks and five sticks. However, all five birds failed to discriminate between three sticks and four sticks. Wild Northern Mockingbirds thus appear to have a limited capacity to solve novel foraging problems by minimizing the number of obstacles to be removed. /// La teoría del forrajeo óptimo propone que cuando las aves enfrentan opciones alternativas de forrajeo, eligen la que provee la mayor tasa de retorno.

Las aves podían acceder a la recompensa de comida (larvas de Tenebrio) removiendo todos los palitos de uno de los extremos, por lo que el método óptimo de forrajeo consistía en remover los palitos del extremo con menos palitos. Cada sujeto fue examinado en pruebas repetidas para ver si prefería el extremo con menos palitos. Cada una de las cinco aves discriminaron con éxito entre un palito y seis palitos y entre dos y cinco palitos. Sin embargo, ninguna discriminó con éxito entre tres y cuatro palitos.

Performance signatures common across development and across species implicate one system for representing large, approximate numerical magnitudes, and a second system for the precise representation of small numbers of individual objects.

  abstract = {Comparative studies on quantity discrimination in animals are important for understanding potential evolutionary roots of numerical competence. A previous study with angelfish has shown that they discriminate numerically different sets of same-sized food items and prefer the larger set. However, variables that covary with number were not controlled and choice could have been influenced by variables such as size or density of the food items rather than numerical attributes. Here using a recently developed approach, we examined whether contour length of the food items affects choice in a spontaneous binary choice task. In Experiment 1, a contrast of 1 vs. 1 food item was presented, but the ratio between the size (diameter) of the food items was varied. In Experiment 2, numerically different food sets were equated in overall size by increasing the size (diameter) of the items in the numerically small sets. In both Experiments, subjects showed a preference for the larger sized food items with a discrimination limit. These results show that item size plays a prominent role in foraging decisions in angelfish. Experiment 3 placed numerical and size attributes of the sets in conflict by presenting one larger-sized food item in the numerically smaller set that also had smaller overall size (diameter) of food items. Angelfish showed no preference in any of the contrasts, suggesting that they could not make optimal foraging decisions when these attributes were in conflict. Maximization of energy return is central to optimal foraging. Accordingly, here item size was also found to be a key feature of the sets, although the numerical attributes of the sets also influenced the choice.},

  abstract = {The ability to discriminate between larger and smaller quantities has been demonstrated in several mammalian and avian species suggesting the possibility of evolutionary conservation of this characteristic. Preference for the larger of two groups has also been shown in fish species, although this ability has rarely been systematically studied in lower order vertebrates, and thus the mechanisms of such ability are not understood. Here, we exploit the tendency of angelfish to seek protection in an unfamiliar environment by joining a group of conspecifics, a behaviour called shoaling. Test fish were given a simultaneous choice between shoals varying both in terms of numerical ratios and absolute numbers of fish. Our results provide evidence for quantity discrimination in angelfish. In general, experimental subjects chose the larger of two shoals. Furthermore, in agreement with Weber's law, which holds that discrimination between two quantities depends on their ratio, the discrimination between shoals of different quantities of fish was more difficult when the shoal sizes became more similar. The limit of discrimination ratio was found to be below 2:1. Briefly, angelfish are able to discriminate between different quantities of conspecifics subject to a ratio limit, a finding that implies a fitness component in this behaviour similar to what has been demonstrated in higher order vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Although some fish species have been shown to be able to discriminate between two groups (shoals) of conspecifics differing in the number of members, most studies have not controlled for continuous variables that covary with number. Previously, using angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare) we started the systematic analysis of the potential influence of such continuous variables, and found that they play different roles in shoal discrimination depending on whether large (≥ 4 fish) or small ({$<$}4 fish) shoals were contrasted. Here, we examine the potential role of the overall body surface area of stimulus fish in shoal preference, a prominent variable not yet examined in angelfish. We report that both when numerically large (5 versus 10 fish) and when small (2 versus 3 fish) shoals were contrasted, angelfish were unable to discriminate the numerically different shoals as long as the surface area of the contrasted shoals was equated. Thus, we conclude that body surface may be an important continuous variable in shoal discrimination. This conclusion was further supported by the analysis of preference when shoals of the same numerical size but different body surface area were contrasted. We found subjects to spend significantly more time close to the shoals with the greater overall surface area. Last, we conducted an experiment in which we simultaneously controlled a set of continuous variables, including overall surface area, and found angelfish to use the number of shoal members as a cue only in large shoal contrasts but not in small shoal contrasts. This result suggests the potential existence of different processing systems for large and small numbers in fish.},

  abstract = {The ability to discriminate between different quantities has important ecological relevance for animals when engaging in behaviours such as forming groups, foraging or trying to avoid predators. Quantity discrimination has been shown in a diversity of human and nonhuman animal species. In angelfish this discrimination ability has been investigated using dichotomous choice tests when the numerically different stimulus groups (shoals) of conspecifics were fully visible to the test fish. Here, using a new procedure we investigated whether test fish were able to discriminate between the contrasting shoals using their memory. After a period of full visual access to the contrasted shoals on the two sides of their test tank, the test fish was required to make a choice while being able to see only a single member of the stimulus shoals on each side. With this cognitively more demanding procedure we tested discrimination between numerically large shoals (≥ four fish per stimulus shoal). As in our previous studies, we found that angelfish consistently chose the larger of the two shoals when the shoals differed by a 2:1 or higher ratio, but not those that differed by a 3:2 or 4:3 ratio. The results followed Weber's law in that performance became poorer as the ratio between the two stimulus shoals approached one. In addition, when we kept the absolute difference between the contrasted shoals constant, discrimination was less accurate as the shoal sizes increased. This pattern of results lends support for the analogue magnitude representational system in the angelfish, a nonverbal approximation system believed to be employed by a diversity of human and nonhuman animal species. Furthermore, our results also demonstrate that angelfish remember the different shoals presented to them, i.e. they make their choice based upon mental representation of the different quantities.

  abstract = {Predator-prey interactions are vital to the stability of many ecosystems [1]. Yet, few studies have considered how they are mediated due to substantial challenges in quantifying behavior over appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Here, we employ high-resolution sonar imaging to track the motion and interactions among predatory fish and their schooling prey in a natural environment. In particular, we address the relationship between predator attack behavior and the capacity for prey to respond both directly and through collective propagation of changes in velocity by group members [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. To do so, we investigated a large number of attacks and estimated per capita risk during attack and its relation to the size, shape, and internal structure of prey groups. Predators were found to frequently form coordinated hunting groups, with up to five individuals attacking in line formation. Attacks were associated with increased fragmentation and irregularities in the spatial structure of prey groups, features that inhibit collective information transfer among prey. Prey group fragmentation, likely facilitated by predator line formation, increased (estimated) per capita risk of prey, provided prey schools were maintained below a threshold size of approximately 2~m2. Our results highlight the importance of collective behavior to the strategies employed by both predators and~prey under conditions of considerable informational constraints. Video Abstract},

  abstract = {Senescence, the gradual reduction and loss of function as organisms age, is a widespread process that is especially pronounced in cognitive abilities. Senescence appears to have a genetic basis and can be affected by evolutionary processes. If cognitive senescence is shaped by natural selection, it may be linked with selection on cognitive abilities needed for survival and reproduction, such that species where fitness is directly related to cognitive abilities should evolve delayed cognitive senescence likely resulting in higher lifetime fitness. We used wild food-caching mountain chickadees, which rely on specialized spatial cognition to recover thousands of food caches annually, to test for cognitive senescence in spatial learning and memory and reversal spatial learning and memory abilities. We detected no signs of age-related senescence in spatial cognitive performance on either task in birds ranging from 1 to 6 years old; older birds actually performed better on spatial learning and memory tasks. Our results therefore suggest that cognitive senescence may be either delayed (potentially appearing after 6 years) or negligible in species with strong selection on cognitive abilities and that food-caching species may present a useful model to investigate mechanisms associated with cognitive senescence.},

However, the adaptive significance of numerical discriminations in wild animals is almost completely unknown. We conducted a series of experiments to test whether a food-hoarding songbird, the New Zealand robin Petroica australis, uses numerical judgements when retrieving and pilfering cached food. Different numbers of mealworms were presented sequentially to wild birds in a pair of artificial cache sites, which were then obscured from view. Robins frequently chose the site containing more prey, and the accuracy of their number discriminations declined linearly with the total number of prey concealed, rising above-chance expectations in trials containing up to 12 prey items. A series of complementary experiments showed that these results could not be explained by time, volume, orientation, order or sensory confounds. Lastly, a violation of expectancy experiment, in which birds were allowed to retrieve a fraction of the prey they were originally offered, showed that birds searched for longer when they expected to retrieve more prey. Overall results indicate that New Zealand robins use a sophisticated numerical sense to retrieve and pilfer stored food, thus providing a critical link in understanding the evolution of numerical competency.},

  abstract = {Studies of human adults, infants, and non-human animals demonstrate that non-symbolic numerical cognition is supported by at least two distinct cognitive systems: a “parallel individuation system” that encodes the numerical identity of individual items and an “approximate number system” that encodes the approximate numerical magnitude, or numerosity, of a set. The exact nature and role of these systems, however, have been debated for over a 100-years. Some argue that the non-symbolic representation of small numbers ({$<$}4) is carried out solely by the parallel individuation system and the non-symbolic representation of large numbers ({$>$}4) is carried out solely by the approximate number system. Others argue that all numbers are represented by the approximate number system. This debate has been fueled largely by some studies showing dissociations between small and large number processing and other studies showing similar processing of small and large numbers. Recent work has addressed this debate by showing that the two systems are present and distinct from early infancy, persist despite the acquisition of a symbolic number system, activate distinct cortical networks, and engage differentially based attentional constraints. Based on the recent discoveries, I provide a hypothesis that may explain the puzzling findings and makes testable predictions as to when each system will be engaged. In particular, when items are presented under conditions that allow selection of individuals, they will be represented as distinct mental items through parallel individuation and not as a numerical magnitude. In contrast, when items are presented outside attentional limits (e.g., too many, too close together, under high attentional load), they will be represented as a single mental numerical magnitude and not as distinct mental items. These predictions provide a basis on which researchers can further investigate the role of each system in the development of uniquely human numerical thought.},

  abstract = {Behavioral research suggests two cognitive systems are at the foundations of numerical thinking: one for representing 1-3 objects in parallel and one for representing and comparing large, approximate numerical magnitudes. We tested for dissociable neural signatures of these systems in preverbal infants, by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) as 6-7.5 month-old infants (n = 32) viewed dot arrays containing either small (1-3) or large (8-32) sets of objects in a number alternation paradigm. If small and large numbers are represented by the same neural system, then the brain response to the arrays should scale with ratio for both number ranges, a behavioral and brain signature of the approximate numerical magnitude system obtained in animals and in human adults. Contrary to this prediction, a mid-latency positivity (P500) over parietal scalp sites was modulated by the ratio between successive large, but not small, numbers. Conversely, an earlier peaking positivity (P400) over occipital-temporal sites was modulated by the absolute cardinal value of small, but not large, numbers. These results provide evidence for two early developing systems of non-verbal numerical cognition: one that responds to small quantities as individual objects and a second that responds to large quantities as approximate numerical values. These brain signatures are functionally similar to those observed in previous studies of non-symbolic number with adults, suggesting that this dissociation may persist over vast differences in experience and formal training in mathematics.},

I tested whether sociality affects quantity discrimination in the wild by comparing the performances of the highly social Mexican jay (MJ; Aphelocoma wollweberi) and the territorial Western scrub jay (WJ; Aphelocoma californica). The birds were given a choice between two lines of peanuts that differed in initial quantity ranging from 2 vs 8 to 14 vs 16. Their choices were recorded until all peanuts were eaten or cached. Whereas non-social WJ selected the larger quantity across all the trials significantly more than chance, social MJ selected the larger line only when the difference in the number of peanuts between lines was small. In MJ, individual choice when selecting the large or small quantity was influenced by what line the previous bird had chosen when the difference in lines was large, with followers significantly more likely to select the smaller quantity. WJ were not significantly affected by the choices of other individuals. The only factors that influenced WJ choice were ratio and total differences between the two quantities. These results suggests that in certain scenarios, both species can discriminate between different quantities. However, MJ were greatly influenced by social factors, a previously untested factor, while WJ were only influenced by ratio and total difference between the quantities, consistent with findings in other species. Overall, this study demonstrates the important role of sociality in numerical cognitive performance, a previously overlooked factor. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Studies of group-living animals show that movement order among individuals is also consistent over time and context, suggesting that some individuals lead and others follow. However, the relationship between leadership and personality traits is poorly studied. We measured several personality traits and leadership of individual barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis. We~measured body size and scored the dominance of individuals living in a stable group situation before subjecting them to an open-field test, an activity test, a novel-object test, and a leadership test in which the order of the movement of individuals in pairs towards a feeding patch was scored. We found high repeatability for activity and novel-object scores over time. Leadership was strongly correlated with novel-object score but not with dominance rank, activity or exploration in an open field. These results provide evidence that leadership is closely related to some aspects of personality. Interestingly, an individual's arrival at the food patch was affected not only by the novel-object score of the focal individual, but also by the novel-object score of the companion individual, indicating that movement patterns of individuals living in groups are affected by the personality traits of other group members and suggesting that movement patterns of a group may be shaped by the mix of personality types present in the group.},

We use a linear programming approach to build a time budget model that predicts the upper bound on group size in order to test the hypothesis that fission–fusion social systems are the outcome of time constraints. Comparative data from 14 wild chimpanzee (Pan spp.) populations are used to derive a set of equations defining the relationship between climatic variables and time budget components, which are then used to calculate the upper limits on group size that can be maintained in different habitats. We validate the model by showing that it correctly predicts the presence/absence of chimpanzees across sub-Saharan Africa and the group sizes observed in natural populations. The model suggests that the costs of travel are limiting for chimpanzees. Chimpanzees can reduce these costs dramatically by fissioning their bonded communities into small foraging parties. If they did not, they would be unable to live in any habitats where they currently occur.},

  abstract = {An intriguing aspect of social foraging behaviour is that large groups are often no better at capturing prey than are small groups, a pattern that has been attributed to diminished cooperation (i.e., free riding) in large groups. Although this suggests the formation of large groups is unrelated to prey capture, little is known about cooperation in large groups that hunt hard-to-catch prey. Here, we used direct observations of Yellowstone wolves (Canis lupus) hunting their most formidable prey, bison (Bison bison), to test the hypothesis that large groups are more cooperative when hunting difficult prey. We quantified the relationship between capture success and wolf group size, and compared it to previously reported results for Yellowstone wolves hunting elk (Cervus elaphus), a prey that was, on average, 3 times easier to capture than bison. Whereas improvement in elk capture success levelled off at 2–6 wolves, bison capture success levelled off at 9–13 wolves with evidence that it continued to increase beyond 13 wolves. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hunters in large groups are more cooperative when hunting more formidable prey. Improved ability to capture formidable prey could therefore promote the formation and maintenance of large predator groups, particularly among predators that specialize on such prey.},

To resolve these issues, we tested the numerical discrimination performance of human subjects and two rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) in an identical delayed match-to-numerosity task for a broad range of numerosities from 1 to 30. The results demonstrate a noisy nonverbal estimation system obeying Weber's Law in both species. With average Weber fractions in the range of 0.51 and 0.60, nonverbal numerosity discriminations in humans and monkeys showed similar precision. Moreover, the detailed analysis of the performance distributions exhibited nonlinearly compressed numerosity representations in both primate species. However, the difference between linear and logarithmic scaling was less pronounced in humans. This may indicate a gradual transformation of a logarithmic to linear magnitude scale in human adults as the result of a cultural transformation process during the course of mathematical education.},

However, whether birds possess the conceptual grasp and cognitive control to flexibly switch between relative more-or-less-than judgments remains elusive. We therefore tested carrion crows in a rule-based line-length discrimination task to flexibly select lines presented on a touchscreen according to their relative length. In the first experiment, the crows needed to discriminate a shorter from a longer line, and vice versa. In the second experiment, the crows were required to choose a medium long line among three lines of different length (intermediate-size task). The crows switched effortlessly between “longer than/shorter than” rules, showing no signs of trial history affecting switching performance. They reliably chose the relatively longer and shorter line length, thus demonstrating a concept of greater than/less than with a continuous magnitude. However, both crows failed to discriminate a line of ‘medium’ length embedded in longer and shorter lines. These results indicate that relational discrimination exhibits different cognitive demands. While a greater than/less than concept requires only one relational comparison (with the respectively greater or smaller magnitude), the discrimination of a ‘medium’ magnitude demands to relate two or more comparisons, which might overburden crows and maybe animals in general.

This review compares the cognitive and physiological mechanisms found in a nonhuman primate, the rhesus macaque, and a corvid songbird, the carrion crow, in order to elucidate the evolutionary adaptations underlying numerical competence. Monkeys and corvids are known for their advanced cognitive competence, despite them both having independently and distinctly evolved endbrains that resulted from a long history of parallel evolution. In both species, numerosity is represented as an analogue magnitude by an approximate number system that obeys the Weber–Fechner Law. In addition, the activity of numerosity-selective neurons in the fronto-parietal association cortex of monkeys and the telencephalic associative area nidopallium caudolaterale of crows mirrors the animals' performance. In both species' brains, neuronal activity is tuned to a preferred numerosity, encodes the numerical value in an approximate fashion, and is best represented on a logarithmic scale. Collectively, the data show an impressive correspondence of the cognitive and neuronal mechanisms for numerosity representations across monkeys and crows. This suggests that remotely related vertebrates with distinctly developed endbrains adopted similar physiological solutions to common computational problems in numerosity processing.

  abstract = {Breeding birds use a variety of cues to choose a nest site. For conspecific brood parasites, the number of eggs in a host nest may be an important indicator of nest stage (laying or incubating) and the resulting prospective value of the nest. In precocial birds, such as wood ducks (Aix sponsa), a parasitic female should lay her eggs during the host’s laying stage to ensure hatch synchrony with the host. Incubation and hatching success may also be compromised in large clutches. Accordingly, parasitic females should respond to the number of eggs already present in a potential hosts’ nest and should preferentially lay eggs in nests with smaller clutches. We conducted a field experiment using simulated nests containing different numbers of “host” eggs to test this hypothesis. When offered a choice of nests containing clutches of 5, 10, 15, or 20 eggs, females were significantly more likely to lay eggs in the 5- and 10-egg treatments, laid more eggs in total in the smaller clutch treatments, and were more likely to incubate the nests in the 5- and 10-egg treatments. These results indicate that wood ducks are responsive to quantitative cues, such as the number of eggs in a nest, although we do not yet know if they are able to do so directly by numerical discrimination (i.e., counting).},

When number was held constant and mass was varied in Experiment 3, the pigeons showed a clear preference for the larger mass symbols on single-symbol and summation tests.

  abstract = {Debates have arisen as to whether non-h­ uman animals actually can learn abstract non-­symbolic numerousness or whether they always rely on some continuous physical aspect of the stimuli, covarying with number. Here, we investigated archerfish (Toxotes jaculatrix) non-­symbolic numerical discrimination with accurate control for covarying continuous physical stimulus attributes. Archerfish were trained to select one of two groups of black dots (Exp. 1: 3 vs 6 elements; Exp. 2: 2 vs 3 elements); these were controlled for several combinations of physical variables (elements’ size, overall area, overall perimeter, density, and sparsity), ensuring that only numerical information was available. Generalization tests with novel numerical comparisons (2 vs 3, 5 vs 8, and 6 vs 9 in Exp. 1; 3 vs 4, 3 vs 6 in Exp. 2) revealed choice for the largest or smallest numerical group according to the relative number that was rewarded at training. None of the continuous physical variables, including spatial frequency, were affecting archerfish performance. Results provide evidence that archerfish spontaneously use abstract relative numerical information for both small and large numbers when only numerical cues are available.},

When required to choose the more frequently occurring stimulus between two stimuli presented repeatedly in sequence, accuracy improves as the distance between number increases (distance effect) and decreases as distance is held constant and the size of the numbers increases (magnitude effect). These effects were shown in three experiments reported with pigeons as subjects. It was shown that a single model based on discrimination between noisy numerical representations could account for both the primate and bird findings. To model the pigeon data, an additional decay parameter was necessary to account for strong recency effects found for the influence on choice of terminal stimuli presented in a sequence.

Humans may nonetheless share a subset of non-verbal numerical skills, available soon after birth and considered the evolutionary foundation of more complex numerical reasoning, with other animals. These skills are thought to be based on the two systems: the object file system which processes small values (\textbackslash 3) and the analogue magnitude system which processes large magnitudes ([4). Infants’ ability to discriminate 1 vs. 2, 1 vs. 3, 2 vs. 3, but not 1 vs. 4, seems to indicate that the two systems are independent, implying that the conception of a continuous number processing system is based on precursors that appear to be interrupted at or about the number four. The findings from the study being presented here indicating that chicks are able to make a series of discriminations regarding that borderline number (1 vs. 4, 1 vs. 5, 2 vs. 4) support the hypothesis that there is continuity in the number system which processes both small and large numerousness.},

These dynamics have major implications at both population and individual levels, exerting an important influence on patterns of social behaviour, information transfer and epidemiology. However, fission–fusion dynamics in birds have received relatively little attention. We review the existing evidence for fission–fusion sociality in birds alongside a more general explanation of the social and ecological processes that may drive fission–fusion dynamics. Through a combination of recent methodological developments and novel technologies with well-established areas of ornithological research, avian systems offer great potential to further our understanding of fission–fusion social systems and the consequences they have at an individual and population level. In particular, investigating the interaction between social structure and environmental covariates can promote a deeper understanding of the evolution of social behaviour and the adaptive value of group living, as well as having important consequences for applied research.},

Frogs showed quantity discrimination in the range of both small (1 vs. 2, 2 vs. 3, but not 3 vs. 4) and large numerousness (3 vs. 6, 4 vs. 8, but not 4 vs. 6), with clear evidence of being able to discriminate numerousness even when continuous physical variables were controlled for in the case of small numerousness (i.e., 1 vs. 2), whereas in the case of large numerousness it remains unclear whether the number or surface areas were dominant. We suggested that task demands are likely to be responsible for the activation of different systems for small and large numerousness and for their relative susceptibility to quantitative stimulus variables.},

More poorly understood are the conditions under which animals use numerical versus non-numerical quantification, and the nature of the relation between these two systems. Here we test whether cotton-top tamarins and common marmosets can discriminate between two quantities on the basis of the amount of food rather than on number. In three experiments, we show that when choosing between arrays containing different numbers and sizes of food objects, both species based their decisions on the amount of food with only minor influences of numerical information. Further, we find that subjects successfully discriminated between two quantities differing by a 2:3 or greater ratio, which is consistent with the ratio limits found for numerical discrimination with this species. These studies demonstrate that non-human primates possess mechanisms that enable quantification of total amount, in addition to the numerical representations demonstrated in previous studies, with both types of quantification subject to similar processing limits.},

However, such abilities have been much less studied during ontogeny. In the present study we examined spontaneous quantity discrimination by pre-weaning age kittens in two-way food choice experiments. In Experiment 1, 26 kittens performed 12 trials with different ratios between the number of same-size food items. In Experiment 2, 24 other kittens performed eight trials with different ratios between the size of two food items. We found, in general, that the kittens discriminated between the different amounts of food and spontaneously chose the larger one, but that their choice was influenced by the ratio of difference. The kittens in Experiment 1 chose the larger number of same-size food items if the ratio was smaller than 0.4 and in Experiment 2 they chose the larger pieces of food if the ratio between the items was smaller than 0.5. Because the kittens’ choice was not influenced by the absolute number of food items or the numerical difference between them in Experiment 1, it suggests that their cognitive performance relied on an analog magnitude system rather than on an object file system during the quantity discrimination tasks. We discuss our results considering the ecological and social background of cats and compare it with the performance of previously studied species.},

We presented 2 sets of nuts simultaneously, in 21 different conditions, to see if the nutcrackers could choose the larger of the 2 quantities. The nutcrackers displayed a strong ability to discriminate quantities of nuts. Like other animals tested previously, the nutcrackers' performance decreased as the ratio of the 2 quantities approached 1. Interestingly, at constant distances, the nutcrackers did not have more difficulty with contrasts containing larger quantities. Thus, nutcrackers have a fine sensitivity for discriminating between 2 quantities. We review the relevant literature and explore the possibility that nutcrackers, like some other birds, may have developed a keen ability to discriminate quantities. This ability may have developed as an adaptive specialization to cope with their scatter-hoarding ecology, though the evidence for such a conclusion is mixed.},

We already know that some primate species and human infants represent and enumerate objects in similar ways. Considerable data also exist concerning such abilities in birds. Our aim in this study has been to find out whether jackdaws (Corvus monedula) are capable of performing relative quantity judgments based on mental representations, and if so, what are the limiting factors to their abilities. In our setting the birds were required to make a choice between two visibly and sequentially placed set of food items which, at the moment of choice were not visible to the subjects. We investigated all the number combinations between 1 and 5. Our results show that jackdaws are able to perform relative quantity judgments successfully, even when temporal cues are controlled for, whereas their performance declines in the direction of larger set size (numerical size effect), and when the difference between the two arrays decreases (numerical distance and ratio effect). These signatures are usually interpreted as evidence for the 'accumulator' model of mental representation of quantity. Our control results suggest that jackdaws do not use temporal cues, but may well use total volume as basis for discrimination, perhaps among other attributes (choice may be based on multiple cues).

We investigated the numerical abilities of three American black bears, Ursus Americanus, by presenting discrimination tasks on a touch-screen computer. One bear chose the larger of two arrays of dot stimuli, while two bears chose the smaller array of dots. On some trials, the relative number of dots was congruent with the relative total area of the two arrays. On other trials, number of dots was incongruent with area. All of the bears were above chance on trials of both types with static dots. Despite encountering greater difficulty with dots that moved within the arrays, one bear was able to discriminate numerically larger arrays of moving dots, and a subset of moving dots from within the larger array, even when area and number were incongruent. Thus, although the bears used area as a cue to guide their responses, they were also able to use number as a cue. The pattern of performance was similar to that found previously with monkeys, and suggests that bears may also show other forms of sophisticated quantitative abilities.},

We found that a proportion of NCL neurons were spontaneously responsive to numerosity and tuned to the number of items, even though the crows were never trained to assess numerical quantity. Our data show that numerosity-selective neuronal responses are spontaneously present in the distinct endbrains of diverge vertebrate taxa. This seemingly hard-wired property of the avian endbrain to extract numerical quantity explains how birds in the wild, or right after~hatching, can exploit numerical cues when making foraging or social decisions. It suggests that endbrain circuitries that evolved based on convergent evolution, such as the avian endbrain, give rise to the same numerosity code.},

  abstract = {In the field of psychology, the practice ofp value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage–Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method’s validity, generality, and flexibility.},

Identical populations of three size—classes of bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) were stocked on both sides of a divided pond (29 m in diameter), and eight piscivorous largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were introduced to one side. Sizes of both species were chosen such that the small class of bluegills was very vulnerable to the bass, whereas the largest class was invulnerable to bass predation. We then compared mortality, habitat use, and growth of each size—class in the presence and absence of the bass. Only the small size—class suffered significant mortality from the bass (each bass consumed on average about one small bluegill every 3.8 d); the two larger size—classes exhibited similar mortality rates on both sides of the pond. In the absence of the bass, we found that habitat use of all size—classes was similar and that the pattern of habitat use maximized foraging return rates (Werner et al. 1983). In the presence of the bass the two larger size—classes chose habitats to maximize return rates, but the small size—class obtained a greater fraction of its diet from the vegetation habitat, where foraging return rates were only one—third of those in the more open habitats. The small size—class further exhibited a significant depression in individual growth in the presence of the bass; the growth increment during the experiment was 27\% less than that for small bluegills in the absence of the bass. Because of the reduced utilization of more open habitats by the small fish in the presence of bass, resources in these habitats were released to the larger size—classes, which showed greater growth in the presence of the bass than in its absence. We develop methods to predict the additional mortality expected on a cohort due to a reduction in growth rate (because individuals are spending a longer time in vunerable sizes), and discuss and potential for predation risk to enforce size—class segregation, which leads de facto to resource partitioning.},

In three experiments, cowbirds investigated and laid eggs in artificial nests that differed in the number of eggs they contained. Across days, we added eggs to nests at different rates to simulate differences in the timing of reproduction of the hosts. Cowbirds avoided a nest if the number of eggs that had been added was less than the number of days that had elapsed. The ability of females to remember egg number and compare changes in egg number across days allows them to select nests most suitable for parasitism.},

  abstract = {Identifying the amount of prey available is an important part of an animal's foraging behaviour. The risk-sensitive foraging theory predicts that an organism's foraging decisions with regard to food rewards depending upon its satiation level. However, the precise interaction between optimal risk-tolerance and satiation level remains unclear. In this study, we examined, firstly, whether cuttlefish, with one of the most highly evolved nervous system among the invertebrates, have number sense, and secondly, whether their valuation of food reward is satiation state dependent. When food such as live shrimps is present, without training, cuttlefish turn toward the prey and initiate seizure behaviour. Using this visual attack behaviour as a measure, cuttlefish showed a preference for a larger quantity when faced with two-alternative forced choice tasks (1 versus 2, 2 versus 3, 3 versus 4 and 4 versus 5). However, cuttlefish preferred the small quantity when the choice was between one live and two dead shrimps. More importantly, when the choice was between one large live shrimp and two small live shrimps (a prey size and quantity trade-off), the cuttlefish chose the large single shrimp when they felt hunger, but chose the two smaller prey when they were satiated. These results demonstrate that cuttlefish are capable of number discrimination and that their choice of prey number depends on the quality of the prey and on their appetite state. The findings also suggest that cuttlefish integrate both internal and external information when making a foraging decision and that the cost of obtaining food is inversely correlated with their satiation level, a phenomenon similar to the observation that metabolic state alters economic decision making under risk among humans.},

  abstract = {Several studies have suggested that vertebrate and invertebrate species may possess a number sense, i.e. an ability to process in a non-symbolic and non-verbal way the numerousness of a set of items. However, this hypothesis has been challenged by the presence of other non-numerical continuous physical variables, which vary along with numerosity (i.e., any change in the number of visual physical elements in a set naturally involves a related change in visual features such as area, density, contour length and convex hull of the stimulus). It is therefore necessary to control and manipulate the continuous physical information when investigating the ability of humans and other animals to perceive numerousness. During decades of research, different methods have been implemented in order to address this issue, which has implications for experiment replicability and inter-species comparisons, since no general standardized procedure is currently being used. Here we present the ‘Generation of Numerical Elements Images Software’ (GeNEsIS) for the creation of non-symbolic numerical arrays in a standardized and user-friendly environment. The main aim of this tool is to provide researchers in the field of numerical cognition a manageable and precise instrument to produce visual numerical arrays controlled for all the continuous variables. Additionally, we implemented the ability to actively guide stimuli presentation during habituation/dishabituation and dual-choice comparison tasks used in human and comparative research.},

Observations of intergroup interactions suggest that escalation of aggression depends on numerical assessment, with lethal attacks occurring when numerical advantage reduces the costs of attacking. To gain a better understanding of the factors guiding participation in intergroup conflict, we conducted a series of playback experiments with the Kanyawara chimpanzee community of the Kibale National Park, Uganda. We tested whether the response to the playback of the “pant-hoot” call of a single extragroup male depended on the number of adult males in the listening party, the location of the speaker relative to the territory edge, and each male’s agonistic rank. These playbacks elicited cooperative responses, with the nature of the response depending on the number of adult males in the party. Parties with three or more males consistently joined in a chorus of loud vocalizations and approached the speaker together. Parties with fewer adult males usually stayed silent, approached the speaker less often, and travelled more slowly if they did approach. In contrast to many territorial species, the location of the simulated intruder did not affect the response. Although high-ranking males might be expected to benefit more from repelling outside males, both high- and low-ranking males showed a similar pattern of response. Each male responded as if he benefited from repelling intruders, but only if, he had strength in numbers. This pattern of response is consistent with cooperation based on mutualism.}, note={6}, journal={Animal Behaviour}, author={Wilson, M L and Hauser, M D and Wrangham, R W}, year={2001}, pages={1203–1216} }

Black howler monkeys, Alouatta pigra, produce loud calls that reliably indicate the minimum number of male group members. Using playback recordings, I manipulated ‘numeric odds’ (number of defending to intruding males) to examine whether alpha males use loud calls to assess relative fighting ability, and whether they modify responses to intruders based on relationships with male companions, level of subordinate male cooperation and/or presence of vulnerable offspring in the group. Results indicated that alpha males assess relative fighting ability; howling and approach responses were weakest when subjects faced unfavourable odds. Subordinate male contest participation was inconsistent and alpha males relied less on these unpredictable companions during risky approaches; whereas intruder number affected most howling and approach responses, companion number only influenced howling and orienting duration. Post hoc analyses suggested no effect of alpha-subordinate relationships on alpha reactions. However, preliminary evidence suggested that if subordinates participated, alpha males escalated most when they outnumbered intruders. Alpha males also had shorter howling delays as numeric odds (based on the presence of all subordinates) were increasingly in their favour. Thus, alpha males seemed to escalate in order to signal group-level fighting superiority rather than as a means to gather information on closely matched opponents. Finally, alpha males howled more quickly and for longer at potentially infanticidal intruders if small offspring were present in their group and never called when odds were against their group unless offspring were present, suggesting that contest value was influential.}, note={1}, journal={Animal Behaviour}, author={Kitchen, D M}, year={2004}, pages={125–139}, doi = {10.1016/j.anbehav.2003.03.007} }

Moreover, ratio effects have been used to draw strong conclusions about the nature of numerical representations, how these representations develop, and the degree to which they generalize across stimulus formats. Here, we compute ratio effects for 1,719 children from Grades K–6 for each individual separately by computing not just the average ratio effect for each person, but also the variability and statistical magnitude (effect-size) of their ratio effect. We find that individuals’ ratio effect-sizes in fact increase over development, calling into question the view that decreasing ratio effects over development indicate increasing representational precision. Our data also strongly caution against the use of ratio effects in inferring the nature of symbolic number representation. While 75% of children showed a statistically significant ratio effect for nonsymbolic comparisons, only 30% did so for symbolic comparisons. Furthermore, whether a child’s nonsymbolic ratio effect was significant did not predict whether the same was true of their symbolic ratio effect. These results undercut the notions (a) that individuals’ ratio effects are indicative of representational precision in symbolic numbers, and (b) that a common process generates ratio effects in symbolic and nonsymbolic formats. Finally, for both formats, it was the variability of an individual child’s ratio effect (not its slope or even effect-size) that correlated with arithmetic ability. Taken together, these results call into question many of the long-held tenets regarding the interpretation of ratio effects—especially with respect to symbolic numbers.

The guppy (Poecilia reticulata), the only teleost examined following procedures that allow a comparison with the other vertebrates, outperforms amphibians, reptiles and many warm-blooded vertebrates, but it is unclear whether this is a feature shared with the other teleosts or represents a peculiarity of this species. We trained zebrafish (Danio rerio) to discriminate between numbers differing by one unit, varying task difficulty from 2 versus 3 to 5 versus 6 items. Non-numerical variables that covary with number, such as density or area, did not affect performance. Most fish reached learning criterion on all tasks up to 4 versus 5 discrimination with no sex difference in accuracy. Although no individual reached learning criterion in the 5 versus 6 task, performance was significant at the group level, suggesting that this may represent the discrimination threshold for zebrafish. Numerosity discrimination abilities of zebrafish compare to those of guppy, being higher than in some warm-blooded vertebrates, such as dogs, horses and domestic fowl, though lower than in parrots, corvids and primates. Learning rate was similar in a control group trained to discriminate between different-sized shapes, but zebrafish were slightly more accurate when discriminating areas than numbers and males were more accurate than females. At the end of the experiment, fish trained on numbers and controls trained on areas generalized to the reciprocal set of stimuli, indicating they had used a relational strategy to solve these tasks.}, number={4}, journal={Animal Cognition}, author={Bisazza, Angelo and Santacà, Maria}, year={2022}, month={Aug}, pages={917–933}, language={en} }

Cumulative evidence from comparative studies on number discriminations report obvious analogies among human babies, non-human primates and birds and are consistent with the hypothesis of two distinct and widespread mechanisms, one for counting small numbers (<4) precisely, and one for quantifying large numbers approximately. We investigated the ability to discriminate among different numerosities, in a distantly related species, the mosquitofish, by using the spontaneous choice of a gravid female to join large groups of females as protection from a sexually harassing male. In one experiment, we found that females were able to discriminate between two shoals with a 1:2 numerosity ratio (2 vs. 4, 4 vs. 8 and 8 vs. 16 fish) but failed to discriminate a 2:3 ratio (8 vs. 12 fish). In the second experiment, we studied the ability to discriminate between shoals that differed by one element; females were able to select the larger shoal when the paired numbers were 2 vs. 3 or 3 vs. 4 but not 4 vs. 5 or 5 vs. 6. Our study indicates that numerical abilities in fish are comparable with those of other non-verbal creatures studied; results are in agreement with the hypothesis of the existence of two distinct systems for quantity discrimination in vertebrates.}, number={1}, journal={Animal Cognition}, author={Agrillo, Christian and Dadda, Marco and Bisazza, Angelo}, year={2007}, pages={63–70} }

Specifically, the field lacks a conceptual framework that defines and describes the relevant components of a decision, leading to imprecise language and concepts. The ‘judgment and decision-making’ (JDM) framework in human psychology is a powerful tool for framing and understanding human decisions, and we apply it here to components of animal decisions, which we refer to as ‘cognitive phenotypes’. We distinguish multiple cognitive phenotypes in the context of a JDM framework and highlight empirical approaches to characterize them as evolvable traits.}, number={11}, journal={Trends in Ecology & Evolution}, author={Mendelson, Tamra C. and Fitzpatrick, Courtney L. and Hauber, Mark E. and Pence, Charles H. and Rodríguez, Rafael L. and Safran, Rebecca J. and Stern, Caitlin A. and Stevens, Jeffrey R.}, year={2016}, month={Nov}, pages={850–859} }


 @article{Hamilton.1971, title={Geometry for the selfish herd}, volume={31}, DOI={10.1016/0022-5193(71)90189-5}, abstractNote={This paper presents an antithesis to the view that gregarious behaviour is evolved through benefits to the population or species. Following Galton (1871) and Williams (1964)  gregarious behaviour is considered as a form of cover-seeking in which each animal tries to reduce its chance of being caught by a predator. It is easy to see how pruning of marginal individuals can maintain centripetal instincts in already gregarious species; some evidence that marginal pruning actually occurs is summarized. Besides this, simply defined models are used to show that even in non-gregarious species selection is likely to favour individuals who stay close to others. Although not universal or unipotent, cover-seeking is a widespread and important element in animal aggregation, as the literature shows. Neglect of the idea has probably followed from a general disbelief that evolution can be dysgenic for a species. Nevertheless, selection theory provides no support for such disbelief in the case of species with outbreeding or unsubdivided populations. The model for two dimensions involves a complex problem in geometrical probability which has relevance also in metallurgy and communication science. Some empirical data on this, gathered from random number plots, is presented as of possible heuristic value.}, number={2}, journal={Journal of Theoretical Biology}, author={Hamilton, W D}, year={1971}, pages={295–311} }

Yet we know little about how numerical cognitive abilities compare across different types of objects. Previous research shows individuals use both the numerical difference (large − small) and numerical ratio (small/large) between two numbers to discriminate between them. This study investigated whether numerical difference and ratio predict preferences for quantities of food items and conspecifics in pinyon jays (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) using numerical preference tasks. In two replications of the food experiment (N=12), pinyon jays chose larger quantities of mealworms more when numerical differences were large and numerical ratios were small. However, numerical difference and ratio did not influence food choice independently. In two replications of the social experiment (N=20), when choosing between groups of conspecifics, pinyon jays did not prefer the larger over smaller group sizes and did not show numerical difference or ratio effects. Therefore, pinyon jays may use numerical information differently when deciding between quantities of food items and conspecifics. While quantity was important for selecting food items, other factors such as individual identity may be more important for selecting social groups to join. Thus, the type of objects offered can influence how animals use numerical information to choose among quantities.}, publisher={PsyArXiv}, author={Wolff, London and Carey, Katherine and Stevens, Jeffrey R.}, year={2022}, month={Oct}, language={en-us} }

 @article{Ligon.1978, title={Reproductive interdependence of Piñon Jays and piñon pines}, volume={48}, rights={Copyright © 1978 Ecological Society of America}, ISSN={0012-9615}, DOI={10.2307/2937295}, abstractNote={Piñon Jays (Gymnorhinus cyanoephalus) and piñon pine trees (Pinus edulis) interact in a mutualistic fashion, in that the jays provide a primary means of seed dissemination for piñon trees in the Southwest, while at irregular intervals the trees provide the jays with an abundant and highly nutritious source of food. Availability of piñon seeds permits both late winter (February) and late summer (August) breeding by the jays. Seeds and photoperiod interact synergistically to accelerate gonadal development in late winter. When seeds are abundant, considerable testis growth takes place in some Piñon Jay @M @M even before the winter solstice. This relationship was investigated experimentally. Use of a specific food (piñon seeds) as a proximate timer for breeding, the ability of individual jays to breed in spring, molt, and breed again in August without an intervening period of gonadal refractoriness, and testicular development in early December, when day length approaches its minimum, are extraordinary characteristics among north-temperate-zone passerine birds. The synchrony of seed production by piñon pines over large geographic areas is interpreted as an evolved mechanism that (1) overwhelms invertebrate seed and cone predators, and (2) increases the numbers of seeds per tree that will be cached by Piñon Jays and other vertebrates. Caching sites of Piñon Jays are often at locations especially conducive to germination and growth of piñon pine seedlings.}, number={2}, journal={Ecological Monographs}, author={Ligon, J.
